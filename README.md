HTTP Basic Auth and OAuth Security for a simple REST API

This repository contains several branches to demonstrate different methods of securing a REST API:

   - HTTPBasicAuth
   - OAuth2


The REST API exposes one entity called Courses. You can view available operations and a complete list by sending a GET request to http://localhost:8080/courses .
